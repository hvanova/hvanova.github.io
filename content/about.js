  `My primary focus these days, besides the re-design and development of my personal website, is a data investigation regarding Detroit and Chicago's
        densest neighborhoods. Looking at urban development and mobility data, I aim to tell stories and grow awareness concerning gentrification and displacement. 
        When I'm not at my keyboard, I enjoy volunteering with young learners, fiber-related arts, working in my community gardens, and long 
        walks with my dog.`
