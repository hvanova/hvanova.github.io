export const aboutP1 = `Over the past 5 years, I've gained multidisciplinary experiences in analyzing, engineering, and visualizing data. My professional work includes visualization design and storytelling, data cleaning and preparation, statistical techniques for data exploration, project management, product development, and full-stack engineering.

export const aboutP2 =
  `My primary focus these days, besides the re-design and development of my personal website, is a data investigation regarding Detroit and Chicago's
        densest neighborhoods. Looking at urban development and mobility data, I aim to tell stories and grow awareness concerning gentrification and displacement. 
        When I'm not at my keyboard, I enjoy volunteering with young learners, fiber-related arts, working in my community gardens, and long 
        walks with my dog.`
