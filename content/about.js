  paragraphs: [
    `From research and design to development and testing, I'm committed to empowering individuals by crafting narratives and experiences that inform nuanced understanding and growth through accessible engagement with data.
    Over the past 5 years, I have worked in the data visualization engineering field, including design and storytelling, data cleaning and preparation, statistical techniques for data exploration, cross-team communications, product development, and frontend engineering.
    My interest in social and accessible design drives my work forward in a way that necessitates research, a part of my work that I will always value and prioritize.`,
    `My main focus these days, besides the re-design and development of my personal website, is an investigation into the data on mobility in Detroit and Chicago's
        densest neighborhoods. When I'm not at my keyboard, I enjoy fiber-related arts, volunteering with young learners, working in my community gardens, and going on long 
        walks with my dog.`,
