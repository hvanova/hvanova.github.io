  paragraphs: [
    `Welcome to my website !! Over the past 5 years I've gained professional expertise in data visualization, software engineering, and product development. Most recently As a data engineer, 
        I led a frontend data visualization and metric reporting project, collaborated on building ETL pipelines, and supported analytics teams with database transformations. 
       From research and design to development and testing, I'm committed to empowering individuals by crafting narratives and experiences that inform 
        nuanced understanding and growth through accessible engagement with open source data.`,
    `My main focus these days, besides the re-design and development of my personal website, is an investigation into the data on mobility in Detroit and Chicago's
        densest neighborhoods. When I'm not at my keyboard, I enjoy fiber-related arts, volunteering with young learners, working in my community gardens, and going on long 
        walks with my dog.`,
