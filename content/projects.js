        description: `This study directs attention to modeling groups within a network and observing the influence of group behavior with regards to network convergence toward a value or decision. Regarding the modeling of social phenomena, defining boundaries and behaviors of groups are a focus within the model as they can have a large influence on an individualâ€™s patterns in adopting values depending on a combination of influence measures. 
        The model, programmed in NetLogo, interprets group decision-making influence on equilibrium convergence in multidimensional networks. Various simulations were performed over networks with various measures of clustering, information distribution, individual action probabilities, and group action probabilities.`,

        link: `https://clarkdatalabs.github.io/derrida/`,
        imagePath: `./public/images/derrida.jpeg`,
        description: `Jacques Derrida is one of the major figures of twentieth-century thought, and his library - which bears the traces of decades of close reading - represents a major intellectual archive. The Princeton University Library (PUL) houses Derrida's Margins, a website and online research tool for the annotations of Jacques Derrida. We used data collected from this project to create visualizations of the references used throughout Derrida's De la grammatologie.
        This code can be adapted to create an interactive visualization for any data set, either for book references or another type, which includes many entries, an x-axis location for each entry, a y-axis location for each entry, and information to display with the mouse-over feature. The interactive and visual components are most interesting when entries are not discrete, and can be connected with a significant frequency to many locations along the x-axis.`,

        description: `Networks can provide significant measures to identify data driven patterns and dependencies. Though, given a data file it can be difficult to discern how one may approach creating such a network. In this tutorial, we will use a bibliographic data file downloaded from a query search in Scopus to walk through the process of cleaning the data file, writing a python script to parse the data into nodes and edges, computing graphical measures using NetworkX, and creating an interactive network display using HoloViews.`,
