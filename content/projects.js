        description: `This study directs attention to modeling groups within a network and observing the influence of group behavior with regards to network convergence toward a value or decision. Regarding the modeling of social phenomena, defining boundaries and behaviors of groups are a focus within the model as they can have a large influence on an individualâ€™s patterns in adopting values depending on a combination of influence measures.`,
        role: `Programmed a NetLogo model to interpret group decision-making influence on equilibrium convergence in multidimensional networks. 
        Ran simulations over networks with various measures of clustering, information distribution, individual action probabilities, and group action probabilities.`
